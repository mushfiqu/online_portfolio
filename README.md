# online_portfolio
My online portfolio website, made using Next.Js and Tailwind CSS. This project serves as a way for me to 
learn front-end development using React, HTML, and CSS.
To check my code, refer to the page.js file.

UPDATE: The site has been deployed: https://online-portfolio-fhi3cn35t-mushfiqu.vercel.app/
At the moment, the site is only optimized for desktop.
